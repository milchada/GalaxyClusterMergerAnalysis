1. Lensing

the observed lensing catalog has x, y in arcmin, then g1, g2
291px - 15x28
170px - 26x48
the simulation output has x, y in Mpc, then k, g1, g2 - size 2048 x 2048
these assume a z_source = 1, needed to compute critical density
	though kappa is just the laplacian of the potential
(the internet here is truly appalling)

so i need to convert Mpc --> arcmin given z = 0.2323
then center image on lensing centroid
	how to find lensing centroid for simulation?
	projected mass centroid - aka centre of mass

2. Temperature

these irregular tessellation bins :s
can i get the bin numbers? then use centering + rotation from the brightness maps?
