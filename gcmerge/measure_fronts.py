quantifying the features

#Paul says the physics actually won't affect the width that much
#projection effects will - think of arc intersecting line of sight
#sqrt(x) smoothing - this is just the Abel transform of a delta function along an arc!
#so i can measure this, but assume observed width will be greater 

#it's easier to measure a distance
#from what?

#look at all the movies. how do c1, c2, a affect the merger? Do some of them not matter?
#impact parameter
#discuss with Paul Thursday at 1:30
